## What is the difference between a shallow and a deep copy in Python, with an example?

In Python, the difference between a shallow and a deepcopy is similar to the general concept of copy in programming. Let's take a look at some examples.

### shallow copy in Python:
```
original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
new_list = original_list.copy()
new_list[0][0] = 0

print(original_list) # Output: [[0, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
print(new_list) # Output: [[0, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
In the above example, we create a list called original_list that contains two sub-lists. We then create a new list called new_list and make #ashallowcopy of original_list using the `copy()` method. We modify the first element of the first sub-list in new_list, and we see that the same change is reflected in original_list. This is because the shallow copy creates a new list object, but the elements within the list are still references to the original objects.

### deep copy in Python:
```
import copy

original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)
new_list[0][0] = 0

print(original_list) # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
print(new_list) # Output: [[0, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
In the above example, we use the `deepcopy()` method from the copy module to make a deep copy of original_list. We modify the first element of the first sub-list in new_list, and we see that the change is not reflected in original_list. This is because a deep copy creates a completely new list object with new copies of the elements within the list.

In **summary**, the difference between a shallow and a deep copy in Python is similar to the general concept of copy in programming. A shallow copy creates a new list object, but the elements within the list are still references to the original objects, while a deepcopy creates a completely new list object with new copies of the elements within the list.
