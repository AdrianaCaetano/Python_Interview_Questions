## What is the Lambda Function?
 
Lambda function is a small, anonymous function in programming that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. It is often used as an argument to higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments.
 
In Python, the syntax for creating a lambda function is as follows:
`lambda arguments : expression` 
where arguments are the inputs to the function, and expression is the result that is returned.
 
Lambda functions are generally inline, anonymous functions represented by a single expression. They are used for creating function objects during runtime. They can accept any number of parameters. They are usually used where functions are required only for a short period.
 
For example, here is a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
```
sum = lambda x, y: x + y
print(sum(3, 4))
 
Output:
7
```
