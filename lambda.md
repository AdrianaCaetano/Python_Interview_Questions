## What is the Lambda Function?
 
Lambda function is a small, anonymous function in programming that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. It is often used as an argument to higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments.
 
In Python, the syntax for creating a lambda function is as follows:
`lambda arguments : expression` 
where arguments are the inputs to the function, and expression is the result that is returned.
 
Lambda functions are useful for creating simple, throw-away functions that are used only once. They can also be used for tasks such as filtering data in a list, mapping data, and reducing data.
 
For example, here is a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
```
sum = lambda x, y: x + y
print(sum(3, 4))
 
Output:
7
```
