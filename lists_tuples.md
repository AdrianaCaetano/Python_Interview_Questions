## What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?

**Lists** and **Tuples** are both **sequence data types** that can store a collection of objects in Python. 
The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. 

**Lists** are represented with square brackets ['a', 6, 0.15]. Lists are **mutable**, its elements can be changed. 

**Tuples** are represented with parantheses ('b', 5, 0.17). Tuples on the other hand are **immutable** objects, once created tuples cannot be modified.
