## What is the `apply()` function in Python?
 
The `apply()` function in Python is a built-in function available in the Pandas library, which is a popular open-source library for data analysis and manipulation. In Pandas, the `apply()` function is used to apply a function to each element in a column (or row) of a Pandas DataFrame.
 
The `apply()` function takes two arguments: the function to be applied, and the axis along which the function should be applied (either axis=0 for rows or axis=1 for columns). The function passed as an argument to `apply()` can be either a built-in Python function or a user-defined function.
 
Here's an example of how to use the `apply()` function in Python with a DataFrame:
``` 
import pandas as pd
 
# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
 
# Define a function to be applied to each element
def square(x):
   return x**2
 
# Apply the function to each element in column 'A'
df['A'] = df['A'].apply(square)
 
# The DataFrame now contains the squared values in column 'A'
print(df)
 
Output:
 
  A B
0 1 4
1 4 5
2 9 6
``` 
In this example, the `apply()` function was used to apply the square function to each element in column A of the DataFrame df, resulting in a new DataFrame with the squared values in column A.
