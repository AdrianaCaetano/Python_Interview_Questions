## What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Negative indexes are the indexes from the end of the list or tuple or string.

`Arr[-1]` means the last element of array `Arr[]`

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

#get the last element
print(arr[-1]) #output 6

#get the second last element
print(arr[-2]) #output 5
```
