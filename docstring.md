## What is docstring in Python?

Documentation string or docstring is a multiline string used to document a specific code segment.
A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition that should explain what it does.
Such a docstring becomes the `__doc__` special attribute of that object.

For consistency, always use `"""triple double quotes"""` around docstrings.


```
def function(a, b):
    """Do X and return a list."""
```
