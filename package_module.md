## Differentiate between a package and a module in python

A **module** is a single python file. A module can import other modules (other python files) as objects. Modules, in general, are simply Python files with a `.py` extension and can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented that are reusable in the code as well as across modules. They can be imported and initialized once using the `import` statement. If partial functionality is needed, import the requisite classes or functions using `from foo import bar`.

A **package** is the folder/directory where different sub-packages and modules reside. Packages allow for hierarchial structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. As, modules help avoid clashes between global variable names, in a similar manner, packages help avoid clashes between module names.
Creating a package is easy since it makes use of the system's inherent file structure. So just save the modules into a folder and there you have it, the folder name as the package name. Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module name joined by a dot.

A python package is created by following the below steps:

- Create a directory and give a valid name that represents its operation.
- Place modules of one kind in this directory.
- Create `__init__.py` file in this directory. This lets python know the directory we created is a package. The contents of this package can be imported across different modules in other packages to reuse the functionality.


**Python packages** and **Python modules** are two mechanisms that allow for **modular programming in Python**. Modularizing has several advantages:

- **Simplicity**: Working on a single module helps you focus on a relatively small portion of the problem at hand. This makes development easier and less error-prone.
- **Maintainability**: Modules are designed to enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If they are written in a manner that reduces interdependency, it is less likely that modifications in a module might impact other parts of the program.
- **Reusability**: Functions defined in a module can be easily reused by other parts of the application.
- **Scoping**: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid confusion between identifiers from other parts of the program.
