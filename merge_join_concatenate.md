## What is the difference between merge, join and concatenate in Python?

In Python, **merge**, **join**, and **concatenate** are commonly used operations when working with dataframes and arrays. Although they may seem similar, they have different meanings and purposes. Here's a brief explanation of each:

- **Merge**: Merge is used to combine two dataframes by aligning rows based on one or more common columns. It's similar to an SQL join operation. The resulting dataframe will have all the columns from both dataframes, and the rows will be combined based on matching values in the specified column(s).

- **Join**: Join is similar to Merge but it's a method specifically for pandas dataframes. It can join dataframes based on indexes or columns, and can handle overlapping column names. It's essentially a shortcut for the merge operation when joining on index or columns.

- **Concatenate**: Concatenate is used to join arrays along a specified axis. It stacks arrays vertically or horizontally, depending on the axis parameter. The arrays being concatenated must have the same shape along the specified axis.

In summary, **Merge** and **Join** are used to combine **dataframes** based on common columns, while **Concatenate** is used to join **arrays** along a specified axis.
